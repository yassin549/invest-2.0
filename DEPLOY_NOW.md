## 🔍 What You'll See

After deployment, when you visit the site, you'll see **actual error messages** instead of a blank page.

SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 
1146 Table 'railway.general_settings' doesn't exist
```

This confirms the database is missing tables.

## 📋 Next Steps After Seeing Error

### Step 1: Locate Database File
Check your original HYIP Lab package for:
- `database.sql`
- `hyiplab.sql`
- `install/database.sql`

### Step 2: Import to Railway MySQL

**Option A: Via Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on MySQL service
3. Click "Data" tab
4. Look for import option

**Option B: Via MySQL Client**
```bash
# Get connection details from Railway
mysql -h [MYSQLHOST] -P [MYSQLPORT] -u [MYSQLUSER] -p[MYSQLPASSWORD] [MYSQLDATABASE] < database.sql
```

**Option C: Via phpMyAdmin (if available)**
1. Connect to Railway MySQL
2. Select database
3. Import → Choose file → Go

### Step 3: Verify Tables Created
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
-- Should show 40+ tables including:
-- general_settings, admins, plans, invests, etc.
```

### Step 4: Disable Debug Mode
After database is imported, change back:
```toml
# In nixpacks.toml line 29:
"cd Files/core && echo 'APP_DEBUG=false' >> .env",
```

Then commit and push again.

## 🎯 What the Error Will Tell Us

The error message will confirm:
1. ✅ Laravel is loading correctly
2. ✅ Database connection works
3. ❌ Tables are missing
4. 📍 Exact table name that's missing

---

## 🔐 Database Connection Info

Your Railway MySQL connection details are in environment variables:
- `MYSQLHOST` - Database host
- `MYSQLPORT` - Database port (usually 3306)
- `MYSQLDATABASE` - Database name
- `MYSQLUSER` - Username
- `MYSQLPASSWORD` - Password

You can view these in Railway dashboard → MySQL service → Variables

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't Skip This:** Without the full database, the app cannot work
2. **Keep Debug On:** Until database is imported
3. **Check Original Package:** The SQL file should be in your download
4. **Contact Vendor:** If you can't find the database file

---

## 📞 If You Don't Have Database File

Contact the script vendor (CodeCanyon, etc.) and request:
1. Complete database schema
2. Installation instructions
3. SQL dump file

Or check if there's a web installer in the package.
