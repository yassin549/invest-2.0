# âœ… Pre-Deploy Checklist for Railway

## Before You Push, Verify These:

### 1. Railway Services Setup
- [ ] MySQL service exists and shows **"Active"** status (not "Deploying")
- [ ] App service exists (e.g., `invest-2.0`)
- [ ] Both services are in the same project

### 2. Environment Variables (App Service)
Go to your app service â†’ **Variables** tab:

- [ ] `APP_KEY` is set (example: `base64:8KzP3vJ9mN2qR5tW7xY1zA4bC6dE8fG0hI2jK4lM6nO=`)
- [ ] `APP_URL` is set to your Railway URL (example: `https://invest-20-production.up.railway.app`)
- [ ] MySQL reference is added:
  - Click **"+ New Variable"**
  - Click **"Add Reference"**
  - Select your MySQL service
  - This adds: `MYSQLHOST`, `MYSQLPORT`, `MYSQLDATABASE`, `MYSQLUSER`, `MYSQLPASSWORD`

### 3. MySQL Service Check
Go to MySQL service â†’ **Variables** tab:

You should see these variables (Railway creates them automatically):
- [ ] `MYSQLHOST` (example: `mysql.railway.internal`)
- [ ] `MYSQLPORT` (example: `3306`)
- [ ] `MYSQLDATABASE` (example: `railway`)
- [ ] `MYSQLUSER` (example: `root`)
- [ ] `MYSQLPASSWORD` (a long random string)

### 4. Local Files Check
Verify these files exist in your project:

- [ ] `nixpacks.toml` (in root directory)
- [ ] `Files/core/start.sh` (NEW - created by the fix)
- [ ] `Files/core/.env.example` (should exist)
- [ ] `Files/core/composer.json` (should exist)

### 5. Git Status
Run this to see what will be committed:
```bash
git status
```

You should see:
- Modified: `nixpacks.toml`
- Modified: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- New file: `Files/core/start.sh`
- New file: `FIXES_APPLIED.md`
- New file: `QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
