# Cache Table Fix

## ðŸŽ‰ Great Progress!
The app is now starting and connecting to the database!

## Error Found
```
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'railway.cache' doesn't exist
```

## Problem
The application was trying to access the `cache` table before migrations ran to create it. This happened because:
1. Laravel loads config on boot
2. Config tries to check cache (CACHE_STORE=database)
3. Cache table doesn't exist yet
4. App crashes before migrations can run

## Fix Applied
Updated `start.sh` to clear cache BEFORE running migrations:

```bash
echo "â†’ Clearing any cached config..."
php artisan config:clear || true
php artisan cache:clear || true

echo "â†’ Running migrations..."
php artisan migrate --force --no-interaction
```

The `|| true` ensures the script continues even if cache clearing fails (which it will on first run since the table doesn't exist yet).

## Deploy Now
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix cache table issue - clear cache before migrations"
git push
```

## What Will Happen
1. âœ… Database connection succeeds
2. âœ… Cache cleared (or fails gracefully)
3. âœ… Migrations run and create all tables including `cache`
4. âœ… Config cached successfully
5. âœ… Server starts and stays running

The app should now deploy successfully!
