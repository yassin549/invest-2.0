# AppServiceProvider Fix - Root Cause Found

## 🔴 Critical Issue Identified

The `AppServiceProvider` was checking cache during application bootstrap, BEFORE migrations could run.

### The Problem Code
```php
public function boot(): void {
    if (!cache()->get('SystemInstalled')) {
        $envFilePath = base_path('vendor/psr/log/.env');  // ❌ Wrong path!
        // ... tries to access cache table that doesn't exist yet
    }
}
```

### Two Issues Found:
1. **Wrong .env path** (again!) - `vendor/psr/log/.env` instead of `.env`
2. **Cache table dependency** - Checking cache before migrations create the table

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Changed Cache Driver
**In `nixpacks.toml`:**
```toml
CACHE_STORE=file  # Changed from 'database' to 'file'
```

This allows the app to boot without needing the cache table.

### Fix #2: Fixed AppServiceProvider
**In `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`:**
```php
public function boot(): void {
    try {
        if (!cache()->get('SystemInstalled')) {
            $envFilePath = base_path('.env');  // ✅ Correct path
            // ... check .env file
        }
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // Cache may not be available yet - continue gracefully
    }
}
```

Changes:
- ✅ Fixed .env path from `vendor/psr/log/.env` to `.env`
- ✅ Wrapped cache operations in try-catch
- ✅ App can boot even if cache fails

## 🚀 Deploy Now

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix AppServiceProvider cache and env path issues"
git push
```

## Expected Result

The application should now:
1. ✅ Boot successfully without cache table
2. ✅ Run migrations to create all tables
3. ✅ Use file-based cache (no database dependency)
4. ✅ Start and stay running

## Note

After migrations run successfully, you can optionally change `CACHE_STORE` back to `database` in Railway environment variables if you prefer database caching. But `file` cache works perfectly fine for production.
